The question is already well-structured and unambiguous, but I can make a few minor refinements to make it even more precise:

<question>
What is the current remote work distribution across departments as of today? Include:

Required Data:
- Department name
- Total headcount of active employees (where employee.is_active = true)
- Count of remote workers (where locations.is_remote = true)
- Count of on-site workers (where locations.is_remote = false)
- Remote work percentage (remote workers / total headcount * 100)

Specifications:
1. Only include current positions (employee_positions.end_date IS NULL)
2. Only include active employees (employee.is_active = true)
3. Remote status is determined by the employee's current location (locations.is_remote)
4. Calculate percentages rounded to 2 decimal places
5. Sort results by remote work percentage in descending order
6. Include all departments, even those with 0% remote workers

Tables needed: departments, employee_positions, employee, locations
</question>

The refinements made:
1. Added "as of today" to clarify the time dimension
2. Specified the decimal precision for percentages
3. Clarified that all departments should be included
4. Added explicit table references
5. Structured the requirements in clear sections
6. Added specification about handling null values implicitly
7. Maintained clear measurability and business value
8. Ensured complete alignment with available database structure

This refined version eliminates any potential confusion about time periods, calculation methods, or data inclusion criteria while maintaining the original analytical intent.
