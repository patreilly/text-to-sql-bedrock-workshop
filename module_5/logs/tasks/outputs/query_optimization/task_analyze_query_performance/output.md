# MySQL Query Performance Analysis

## 1. Index Utilization
The current query structure shows several opportunities for improved index utilization:
- Missing composite index on employee_positions (employee_id, start_date)
- Suboptimal index usage in the CTE for latest position lookup
- Recommended new indexes:
```sql
ALTER TABLE hr_core.employee_positions 
ADD INDEX idx_emp_date (employee_id, start_date, end_date);

ALTER TABLE hr_benefits.employee_retirement_plans 
ADD INDEX idx_emp_enroll (employee_id, enrollment_date, contribution_percentage);
```

## 2. Join Strategy
Current join strategy has potential inefficiencies:
- Nested subquery in CTE creates unnecessary table scans
- Multiple cross-schema joins may not be optimally ordered
- Join conditions could be better leveraged for filtering

## 3. Aggregation & Filtering
Current aggregation patterns show room for improvement:
- GROUP BY operations could benefit from covering indexes
- HAVING clause filtering occurs after expensive aggregation
- Opportunity to push down some filtering conditions

## 4. Query Execution Plan
Key bottlenecks identified:
- Full table scan in the CTE subquery
- Multiple join operations across schemas
- Late filtering of results through HAVING clause
- Potential large intermediate result sets

## 5. Performance Bottlenecks
Major inefficiencies:
- Suboptimal approach to finding latest positions
- Cross-schema joins creating network overhead
- Unnecessary complexity in current position determination

## 6. Scalability
For large datasets, current concerns:
- CTE approach doesn't scale well with data volume
- GROUP BY operations on large result sets
- Multiple joins across schemas may degrade with scale

## 7. Optimization Suggestions
Recommended optimized query:
```sql
SELECT 
    d.department_name,
    COUNT(DISTINCT erp.employee_id) as enrolled_employees,
    ROUND(AVG(erp.contribution_percentage), 2) as avg_contribution_percentage,
    ROUND(AVG(ep.salary), 2) as avg_base_salary,
    CONCAT(rp.provider, ' - ', rp.plan_name) as retirement_plan
FROM hr_core.departments d
INNER JOIN hr_core.employee_positions ep ON d.department_id = ep.department_id
    AND ep.end_date IS NULL
INNER JOIN hr_core.employee e ON ep.employee_id = e.employee_id 
    AND e.is_active = true
INNER JOIN hr_benefits.employee_retirement_plans erp ON e.employee_id = erp.employee_id
    AND erp.enrollment_date >= '2019-01-01'
INNER JOIN hr_benefits.retirement_plans rp ON erp.plan_id = rp.plan_id
GROUP BY 
    d.department_name,
    rp.provider,
    rp.plan_name
HAVING 
    COUNT(DISTINCT erp.employee_id) >= 5
ORDER BY 
    avg_contribution_percentage DESC;
```

Key improvements in the optimized query:
1. Eliminates expensive CTE with direct end_date IS NULL check
2. Pushes filtering conditions into JOIN clauses
3. Simplifies the overall query structure
4. Better utilizes available indexes
5. Reduces intermediate result sets
6. Maintains original business logic while improving performance

Additional recommendations:
- Consider partitioning employee_positions if historical data is large
- Implement materialized views for frequently accessed current positions
- Ensure regular statistics updates on involved tables
- Monitor query cache hit ratio for this query pattern

This optimization maintains the original query semantics while significantly improving performance through better index utilization and join strategies.
