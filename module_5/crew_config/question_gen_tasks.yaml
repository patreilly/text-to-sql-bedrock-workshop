task_refine_business_question:
  description: >
    Take the previously generated business question and evaluate it for ambiguity and complexity.
    If it is ambiguous, refine it to be as clear and concise as possible. Ensure the refined question has a
    specific, measurable answer that can be derived from MySQL queries.
    If it is overly nuanced or complex, refine it to be more reasonable and understandable.
    If it is not ambiguous or complex, do nothing
  expected_output: >
